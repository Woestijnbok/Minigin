# Introduction

Welcome to my remake of *Tron Battle Tanks*, this is one of my larger projects that I have done. Mainly because I am made my own engine "Minigin" which has some neat features.
I then used Minigin to create the remake, this remake has some new game modes and a scoreboard. Bullets in this game can bounce up to a maximum amount of 5.
The player and enemies can teleport to a random location when entering the pink diamond in the middle.

# Controls

The game can be played with both a controller and keyboard-and-mouse. The co-op and versus mode can be played with two controllers or one controller and mouse-and-keyboard.

## Keyboard

- **Movement**: You can move around using **WASD**.
- **Combat**: Aiming is done with the **MOUSE** whilst firing is done with **RIGHT MOUSE BUTTON**.
- **Menu**: Go back to the main menu using **BACKSPACE**, navigate it with your **Mouse** and select options with **LEFT MOUSE BUTTON**.
- **Shortcuts**: Skipping levels is done with **F1**, **M** can be used to mute the audio and you can close the game with **ESC**.

## Controller

- **Movement**: Is done with the **DPAD**.
- **Combat**: You can aim using the **RIGHT JOYSTICK** and shoot with **R1**.

# Gamemodes

- **Solo**: This gamemode resembles the original most with 3 unique levels.
- **Co-op**: Here you can play together with a friend against multiple enemies, this has only a single level.
- **Versus**: Similar to co-op but instead like the name suggests against each other, also only one level.

# Enemies

 The game has two main enemies the **Blue Tank** and the **Purple Tank**. The **Blue Tank** will roam around the level an start shooting whilst standing still when he can see a player.
 On the other hand the **Purple Tank** has a bit more health but doesn't shoot instead he tries to collide with the player (moves also faster) like a kamikaze tank.

# Final Thoughts

This project was a very rewarding and challenging opportunity to further improve my game developing journey. I hope you enjoy playing it as much as I enjoyed creating it!
